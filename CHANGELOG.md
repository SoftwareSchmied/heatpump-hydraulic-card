# Changelog

## 0.1.0 – 2026-10-19
First public version.
- Animated schematic: power sources (PV / battery / grid) → heat pump → diverter valve → DHW tank / buffer → heating circuit, house.
- Vendor-neutral core with normalized modes and `mode_map` overrides.
- Preset `lambda` for lambda_heat_pumps, supporting legacy (`sensor.<prefix>_hp1_…`) and new (`sensor.hp1_…`) naming, with automatic prefix detection.
- Optional blocks are hidden when their entities are missing, with a bypass line when there is no buffer.
- UI editor (`getConfigForm`) with grouped entity pickers; English and German.
- Statistics row, custom stat tiles, badges, error chip, more-info on click, reduced-motion support.
