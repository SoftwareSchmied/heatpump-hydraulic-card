# Changelog

## 0.2.0 – 2026-10-19
- **Presets** (not yet tested on real installations) for Viessmann (core ViCare integration, language-independent via entity registry translation keys) and Vaillant aroTHERM (myPyllant, home prefix auto-detected).
- **Heat emitter:** `hc_type: radiator` draws radiators with rising heat waves; underfloor now shows a screed layer.
- **Flow rates:** shown on the heating-side loop; new optional `hc_volume` and `source_volume`.
- **Estimated heat output** from flow rate × spread when no heat sensor exists (marked ≈), including COP.
- **Units:** power in W or kW, heat in kW or W, flow rate in l/h, l/min or m³/h are converted.
- `device` option to restrict preset detection to one device; binary error sensors supported.
- Mode chip shows "Hot water" when the valve is on DHW even if the integration reports "heating".
- Pipes without a temperature sensor keep their base colour instead of turning grey.

## 0.1.0 – 2026-10-19
First public version.
- Animated schematic: power sources (PV / battery / grid) → heat pump → diverter valve → DHW tank / buffer → heating circuit, house.
- Vendor-neutral core with normalized modes and `mode_map` overrides.
- Preset `lambda` for lambda_heat_pumps, supporting legacy (`sensor.<prefix>_hp1_…`) and new (`sensor.hp1_…`) naming, with automatic prefix detection.
- Optional blocks are hidden when their entities are missing, with a bypass line when there is no buffer.
- UI editor (`getConfigForm`) with grouped entity pickers; English and German.
- Statistics row, custom stat tiles, badges, error chip, more-info on click, reduced-motion support.
